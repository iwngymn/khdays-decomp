# Contributing

Thanks for helping decompile *Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days*! The workflow is simple:
pick a function, write code that compiles to the **exact same bytes** as the
original, and open a PR.

For PR scope, commit titles and message bodies, see
[Commit and pull request style](docs/CONTRIBUTION_STYLE.md) and the
[PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md).

## The one rule: byte-exact

A function is only accepted when it passes byte-exact verification. The verifier
must print `>>> MATCH <<<`. This is the quality gate for merging matching work.

Byte-exact matching is not the same thing as public C decompilation progress.
Inline ASM stubs can match the original bytes, but they are not counted as real
C decompilation. See [docs/PROGRESS_POLICY.md](docs/PROGRESS_POLICY.md) for the
reporting policy.

## What counts as decompiled progress?

Only real C code that passes byte-exact verification counts as C-decompiled
progress.

Inline ASM, ASM stubs, `NON_MATCHING`, or placeholder code can be useful while
researching a function, but they must be labeled clearly and must not be counted
as real C decompilation.

SDK/library functions identified through byte matching are useful for naming and
understanding the binary, but they are tracked separately from game-code
decompilation.

When contributing a function, please specify whether it is:

- real C matched
- non-matching C
- inline ASM placeholder
- SDK/library identification
- symbol/name-only improvement

## Claiming work

Functions are grouped by **module/overlay** (`ov000`, `ov030`, ...). To avoid
duplicated effort, **claim a module before you start**:

1. Check [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for a module that is not finished.
2. Open or comment on a GitHub issue titled e.g. `Claim: ov030` and assign
   yourself. Un-claim if you stop working on it.
3. Work through that module's `func_*` functions and PR them.

Collisions are harmless: byte-exact verification means only matching code is
merged, so nothing breaks if two people overlap. Claiming just saves wasted
effort. Use the project Discord / decomp.me for live coordination.

## Setup

You must provide your own legally-obtained copy of the game. Nothing
copyrighted is distributed here.

### Reference ROM

This project targets one specific ROM dump. If your `days.nds` does not match
these hashes, addresses will not line up and `dsd` extraction will produce a
different config.

| | |
|---|---|
| File | `days.nds` |
| Size | 268,435,456 bytes (256 MiB) |
| Region | EU (gamecode `YKGP`, maker `GD` = Square Enix) |
| SHA-1 | `6fae8f5bbe80114b4e2535260eab5f4d0fc8a844` |
| SHA-256 | `1ecf5e7a41a2ae48e7c5fd3f678e5a79e854d843f1a1fa3a952a41b14e51ec4f` |
| MD5 | `6eac99ad1f77920bdafbc71fd6418cc8` |

Verify with `sha1sum days.nds`. If your dump differs, this project is not
directly usable; addresses in `config/`, `func_index.json`, and committed source
were computed against the EU dump above.

1. **Python deps:** `pip install capstone pyelftools ndspy`
2. **`dsd`** (DS extraction/delinking): download from
   [AetiasHax/ds-decomp releases](https://github.com/AetiasHax/ds-decomp/releases)
   and place it at `tools/dsd.exe`.
3. **`mwccarm` 3.0 build 139** (CodeWarrior for Nintendo DS 2.0 SP2 compiler).
   Place the binaries under `tools/mwccarm/3.0_patch4/`.
4. **`arm-none-eabi-as`** (Arm GNU Toolchain / devkitARM) on PATH.
5. **Extract your ROM** with `dsd`:
   ```sh
   tools/dsd.exe rom extract --rom days.nds --output-path dsd_extract/
   tools/dsd.exe init --rom-config dsd_extract/config.yaml --output-path config/ \
       --build-path build/ --allow-unknown-function-calls
   tools/dsd.exe delink --config-path config/arm9/config.yaml
   tools/dsd.exe dis --config-path config/arm9/config.yaml --asm-path asm/
   ```
6. Generate the candidate lists: `python tools/find_candidates.py` and
   `python tools/find_calls.py`.

## Building and verifying byte-exact modules

The `dsd` + `mwccarm` + `mwldarm` pipeline is wired via ninja. From the
project root, after the setup above:

```sh
python tools/configure.py       # gen delinks, dsd delink, dsd lcf, build.ninja
ninja                            # compile matched .c + mwld link -> build/arm9.elf
ninja build/arm9.elf            # arm9.elf is NOT in the default target set
tools/dsd.exe check modules --config-path config/arm9/config.yaml -f
bash tools/build_rom.sh          # pack build/days.nds from the patched bins + verify
```

`dsd check modules` compares each built per-module `.bin` against the base ROM
and exits non-zero if any module is not byte-exact. Baseline: **306 / 306
modules byte-exact**. The old BL-vs-BLX overlay drift is repaired post-link by
`tools/fix_interwork.py` (auto-run inside `tools/_run_mwld.py`), so `ninja
build/arm9.elf` alone yields byte-exact module bins.

`tools/build_rom.sh` then runs `dsd rom config` + `dsd rom build` to pack
`build/days.nds` from those patched bins, restoring the per-overlay `signed`
flag that `dsd rom config` drops (it can't recover it from the ELF). The packed
ROM matches the reference dump to **4 non-functional CRC bytes** (0x6C/0x6D
secure-area CRC, 0x15E/0x15F header CRC) — the DS firmware recomputes those from
image content. See
[project-khdays-blx-followup](../.claude/projects/E--KH-3582-decomp/memory/project_khdays_blx_followup.md)
for the full pipeline history.

For per-function byte-parity while iterating, compare the compiled `.o`
against the `dsd` delink output directly — this is faster than a full
module rebuild and catches the failure right at the function boundary:

```sh
# after `ninja`, given a src/overlays/ov030/calls/func_ov030_020b3e84.c
python -c "
o = open('build/delinks/src/overlays/ov030/asm_stubs/calls/func_ov030_020b3e84.o', 'rb').read()
n = open('build/link/func_ov030_020b3e84.o', 'rb').read()
print(f'byte-exact: {o == n}  size: {len(o)}={len(n)}')
"
```

Note the delink path still points to `asm_stubs/calls/` even after you've
moved the source out of there — dsd keys the delink by *address*, not
path, so the reference `.o` stays put.

If you're new to a function, refresh the mismatch table before iterating:

```sh
python tools/refresh_mismatches.py   # compiles everything, records what diverges
```

This regenerates `build/known_mismatches.txt`, which `gen_delinks.py` reads to
keep faulty decomps out of the link (dsd fills their gap with original bytes).

## Verifying the full ROM round-trip

To confirm your setup is complete and that the project as a whole still rebuilds
the original game, use:

```sh
bash tools/rebuild_rom.sh
```

Expected output is **4 bytes differ**: the secure-area CRC at `0x6C/0x6D` and
the header CRC at `0x15E/0x15F`. Anything more than 4 bytes means something is
broken in the extraction or build configuration.

## Decompiling a function

1. **Claim it** first so nobody duplicates the work.
2. Get its data and the verify command:
   ```sh
   python tools/getcand.py func_XXXXXXXX
   ```
3. Write C to `src/auto/<name>.c` for no external calls, or
   `src/calls/<name>.c` when the function calls other functions.
   If the only match you can produce right now is inline/handwritten ASM,
   put it under `src/asm_stubs/auto/` or `src/asm_stubs/calls/` instead —
   ASM stubs do not count as C decompilation progress.
4. Run the printed `verify_cmd`. Iterate until `>>> MATCH <<<`.
5. Open a focused PR with your new source file(s) and any necessary declarations
   or owning build-path changes. Follow the [scope and verification guide](docs/CONTRIBUTION_STYLE.md).

Good first targets:

- small leaf functions
- functions with simple arithmetic
- getters/setters
- simple state checks
- wrappers that can be expressed in C without inline ASM

Avoid as first targets:

- large gameplay functions
- functions relying on unknown structs
- functions with complex overlays
- functions that only "match" by copying assembly

## Batching similar patterns

A lot of the outstanding asm_stubs are structural repetitions of the same
pattern across many overlays (per-overlay registrar trampolines,
`InstantiateClass(&data_ovNNN_XXXX, arg)` wrappers, `ov107_RegisterHandler`
callback registrations, etc.). When you find one, the fastest path is:

1. **Fingerprint the shape**: tokenize the asm_stub body to `dcd` / `bl` /
   `mov` / etc., then search other overlays for the same shape.
2. **Decode the varying parts**: per-file constants are usually
   `ADD Rn, Rn, #imm` offsets, `MOV Rn, #imm` immediates, or the raw
   `dcd` at the tail of the function (the literal pool address of a
   callback / data ref).
3. **Emit a template C** parameterised by those constants. Verify every
   member independently before committing the batch: full bytes, function
   length, relocation offsets/types/targets/addends, and source meaning.
   Matching one example does not prove that the rest of the family matches.
4. **One commit per pattern**. Explain the semantic in the commit
   message (what the function actually does, which registers/fields it
   touches, what the callee ecosystem looks like). Progress that
   nobody can read later is not progress.

Don't batch faster than you understand. If a shape has variations you
can't explain, split it into sub-shapes rather than papering over.

## Contributing via decomp.me

Do not want to install the toolchain? Use [decomp.me](https://decomp.me); it
runs the compiler in your browser.

1. Generate the scratch fields for a function:
   ```sh
   python tools/decompme.py func_XXXXXXXX
   ```
2. Open <https://decomp.me/new>, pick **Nintendo DS** and compiler
   **3.0 build 139 (MW 2.0sp2p4)**, then paste the printed flags, diff label,
   target assembly, and context.
3. Click **Create scratch**, write C in the editor, and iterate to 100%.
4. Open a PR with the matching C, or share the scratch link.

## Notes

- Some functions are hand-written assembly idioms that the compiler will not
  reproduce from C. Leave those clearly labeled as ASM stubs until a better
  representation is found.
- Compile flags are pinned in `tools/match.py`; do not change them casually.
- Keep C minimal and readable; rename symbols/struct fields in `config/` as you
  understand them.

## Scope reminder

This is a matching decompilation, not a port. Do not add ROM data, assets, or
any copyrighted material to the repository.
