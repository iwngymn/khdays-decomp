/* Release the attachments the actor's state no longer needs, then publish the pose.
 *
 * Largest variant of the Ov*_ReleaseByState shape: three separate handles (+0x3d4, +0x3e4,
 * +0x3c4), a six-value state whitelist {0, 1, 3, 5, 0xa} requesting state 5, and the usual
 * pair of pose publications.
 *
 * One oddity, faithfully reproduced: in the state-9 branch the actor's flag byte is written
 * into a ONE-BIT bitfield at bit 1 of (+0x3e0)->+0x5c, masked with 0xa.  0xa is even, so the
 * assigned bit is always zero and the field is unconditionally cleared -- the ROM's
 * `and #0xa ; lsl #0x1f ; lsr #30` says so plainly.  It looks like the author meant
 * `!= 0`; either way the C has to say what the ROM does, so the mask stays.
