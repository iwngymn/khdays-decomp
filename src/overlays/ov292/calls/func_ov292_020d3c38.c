/* Registered hit handler. Refuses the hit once the actor's hit points are
   spent; otherwise it applies the damage the shared helper computes, clamps the
   remaining points into [0, cap], and plays one of two alternating impact
   sounds unless the event is the specific flag combination that suppresses
   them. Requests state 3 when the points run out, state 6 while the owner is
   already in state 5 or 6, and state 5 for a flagged hit otherwise.

   Same routine as the matched ov128 handler, minus its busy-bit gate: this one
   writes the subtraction straight back to the field and reads it again for the
   clamp, which is what puts the two loads either side of the store.

   The state test is written double-negated because 5 and 6 are consecutive:
   spelled as an ordinary pair of equalities mwcc range-reduces it to
   (unsigned)(x - 5) <= 1, and the ROM keeps the cmp/cmpne cascade. */
