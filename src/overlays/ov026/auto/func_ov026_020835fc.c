/*
 * Ov002_StampTileMode - rewrite the mode nibble across a rectangle of tiles.
 *
 * Walks the request's rectangle in the source's tile map and replaces the top
 * four bits of every entry with the mode, leaving the tile index alone. The row
 * start is worked out from the source's own pixel width, eight pixels to the
 * tile, so the rectangle follows the source's stride rather than the screen's.
 *
 * Both extents are re-read from the request on every pass, which is what the
 * ROM does.
 *
 * ARM. The mode bits are worked out once into their own variable before the
 * loop, which is what puts the shift ahead of the empty-rectangle guard the way
 * the ROM has it; left inside the expression, mwcc hoists it only as far as the
 * loop. The halfword cast on the shift is the same lever as the surface row
 * fill - it emits the same instructions but orders the pack the ROM's way.
