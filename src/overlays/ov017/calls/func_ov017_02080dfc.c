/* Script opcode: hand a resolved target and an int operand to the ov002
 * dispatcher as request 0x11, then drop BG3 and BG1 to priority 0.
 *
 * Two codegen notes about the register pair. BG3CNT and BG1CNT are four bytes
 * apart, so the original loads one pointer and walks it back rather than
 * loading a second address; that is what keeps the literal pool to one word.
 * And the masked value is computed into a temporary before being stored: a
 * plain read-modify-write on the register keeps the pointer in the second
 * scratch register instead of the first and swaps the pair throughout.
