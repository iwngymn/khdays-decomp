/* ov002 gauge tables, 0x0207dd7c-0x0207deb8.
 *
 * A contiguous run of small tables behind the gauge row map and slot advance
 * (Ov002_BuildGaugeRowMap, Ov002_AdvanceGaugeSlot). Each is written in the width its
 * contents are in: word arrays where the values are small integers, byte arrays where
 * the words are packed bytes.
 */

/* mwccarm gives every char array a .rodata/.data section of its own (it handles
 * them like string literals) while int/short/struct tables pool into one section,
 * and the ROM interleaves the two, so no single object layout can reproduce it.
 * Pooling strings folds the char arrays into that one section; the data layout
 * step (tools/reorder_data_sections.py) then places the whole file. Content is
 * unchanged; a non-CodeWarrior compiler ignores the pragma. */
