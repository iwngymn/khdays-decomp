/* func_ov246_020d2098 -- c634 handler: arm the owner for a dash/lunge and hand off to func_ov246_020d216c.
 *
 * Zeroes the object's two counters (obj[9], obj[10]), sets bit 0 of the owner's +0x60
 * config high byte and then clears bits 0x8c of it, sets bit 0 of the byte at
 * *(owner+0x388)+8, copies the owner's facing vector (owner+0x394) into obj[5..7] with
 * obj[8] = 0x1000 as the scale, runs func_01ffa724 to scale that vector into obj[2..4],
 * and dispatches the next state.
 *
 * The +0x60 half-word is a bitfield (unsigned short lo:8, hi:8) -- see
 * func_ov181_020ce664 for the full read-modify-write shape. The |= 1 edit is spelled out
 * because the bitfield form adds a truncation the ROM does not have here (mwcc can prove
 * `hi | 1` still fits 8 bits, but not `hi & ~0x8c`); both spellings are byte-identical
 * where they apply. */
