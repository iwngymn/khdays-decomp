/* func_ov150_020d18f8 -- broadcast this node's position. When the caller's flag word has both
 * bit 0 and bit 4 set, build the 14-byte message from the template at data_ov150_020d259c, pack
 * the node's position vector into bytes 5..13 (three components, each as sign + 23-bit magnitude
 * split high/mid/low), hand it to the object's message hook with length 0xe, clear the pending
 * byte at +0x1c7 and report success. Head of a 5-member family.
 *
 * Two codegen cracks were needed; both are counter-intuitive enough to be worth recording.
 *
 * 1. THE UNREAD STACK COPY.
 *    The ROM also stores the vector into a stack copy that nothing ever reads. Coordinates are
 *    held in a one-value wrapper type (Fx32), a tentative reconstruction of the original's
 *    coordinate type: copying a wrapped value is a struct copy, which mwcc keeps, and that is the
 *    ROM's unread stack copy. A plain int copy is dead-store-eliminated (12 bytes short); copying
 *    the whole vector at once emits a block `ldm`/`stm` and costs registers. Copying one
 *    component at a time gives one load per component, packed from that register, then stored.
 *
 * 2. DO NOT CACHE A POINTER TO THE MESSAGE BUFFER.
 *    With `p = (unsigned char *)&m;` mwcc keeps `p` in a register and addresses the bytes as
 *    `[p, #5]`. Indexing `m` directly at every use lets it fold the whole thing into the frame
 *    pointer, `[sp, #0x11]`, which is what the ROM does and what frees the last register.
