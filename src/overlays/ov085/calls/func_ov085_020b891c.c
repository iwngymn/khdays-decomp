/* Creates the ov085 panel's sub-object: allocates it from the default expanding heap,
 * hangs it off the runtime at +0x2644, resets it, then builds a two-entry parameter
 * table on the stack and opens it. The second entry is a copy of the first with two
 * bits added, which is why the ROM emits an inline four-word copy loop rather than a
 * second run of stores. Finally installs the sub-object's tick handler at its +0x20.
 *
 * Three things are load-bearing and none of them shows in the semantics.
 *
 * The allocation result must NOT be held in a local. Naming it costs a fifth
 * callee-saved register: the ROM pushes r4-r7 plus r3 for alignment and parks the
 * pooled 0x1c9 in ip, while the named form spills it to r8 and changes the push list.
 *
 * The two blocks must be an ARRAY. Written as two separate locals, mwcc sees the
 * second one is never read -- only the first one's address is passed -- and deletes
 * it, and the function comes out 56 bytes short.
 *
 * The assignment order below is the ROM's store order, not ascending by offset, and
 * two positions in it are measurable rather than cosmetic: field0c comes AFTER the
 * zero run (before it, zero and 0x800 swap the callee-saved pair they land in) and
 * field40 comes BEFORE field2c. The zero run must also be eight separate statements;
 * chaining them into one assignment moves the stores. */
