/* Begin the move: acquire the target node, or bail out by requesting state 2.
 *
 * On success it notifies the owner, resets the sub-object, sets the countdown from the
 * template's +0x2c (kept as `* 0x1e / 10`, the multiply-and-magic-divide the ROM emits),
 * picks a random value in [+0x224, +0x228] with the range forced positive, and takes the
 * vector from the acquired node to the current position before handing off to the
 * per-frame step.
 *
 * PARKED behind `extern void func_ov107_020c9264();` -- empty parentheses again, so the
 * zero-argument call under it compiled silently.  It takes (owner, mode, arg), and both
 * of the constants were already visible in the ROM, hoisted well above the call:
 *   - `mov r1, #2` at 0x30 sits ABOVE the branch and does double duty, as the state byte
 *     stored on the bail-out path and as this call's second argument on the other.  That
 *     is the "constant in the wrong register" tell from the pre-park checklist, showing
 *     up as a constant with no visible consumer instead.
 *   - `mov r2, #0` at 0x1c is the third argument, hoisted to the prologue -- and 0x1c is
 *     exactly where the parked version diverged.
 * The park also carried an uninitialised `int v` and a `+ (v - v)` term in the random
 * expression, scaffolding from some earlier hypothesis.  It is not needed: the function
 * matches without it, and reading uninitialised storage is not something to leave in
 * matched code.

/* Head of a 5-member family.  Byte-exact.
 *
 * Why this looked impossible for so long: the ROM hoists two constants above the branch so
 * they serve both paths -- `mov r2,#0` (third argument of the tail func_0203c634) and
 * `mov r1,#2` (the 0x1c7 state). With the callee arities wrong those constants have no
 * visible consumer, which reads exactly like a scheduler difference. Correct the arities
 * and mwcc hoists them too.
 *
 * SOLVED here -- do NOT rediscover:
 *  - func_ov107_020c9264 is called here with NO arguments at all (no r0-r3 setup before the
 *    bl). Passing (obj, 0, 0) is 8 B long. Same callee takes 3 elsewhere -- it is unprototyped,
 *    so read the arity per call site.
 *  - the tail func_0203c634 DOES take its third argument here (dropping it is 4 B short), so
 *    the two calls to the same function in this function have different arities.
 *  - `* 0x1e / 10` reproduces the magic multiply (0x66666667, asr #2).
 *
 * Ruled out: the `+ (v - v)` RNG artifact (identical either way here), a local for the RNG
 * result (+4 B), writing the body as the positive case (112 bytes -- much worse), and caching
 * *obj in a local (no change). Measured with tools/bytedist.py. */
