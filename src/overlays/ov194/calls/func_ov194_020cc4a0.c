/* Release the actor's held handle when its state calls for it, then publish the pose.
 *
 * Fourth variant of the Ov*_ReleaseByState shape, over a control block at +0x3d4 with the
 * handle at its +0x14, and a five-value state whitelist {0, 1, 3, 5, 9} requesting state 5.
 * Matched first try by applying what the three earlier variants cost a session each:
 *  - func_0203c650 takes (owner, handle), and the handle is the field being cleared;
 *  - the pose copies are plain struct assignments through char ** chains, which is what
 *    gives the ROM's ldm/stm register roles (int * chains invert them);
 *  - a whitelist of three or more values needs no care, unlike a two-value guard, which
 *    mwcc folds into an unsigned range test.
