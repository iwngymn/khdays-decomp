/*
 * Tick the timed spin/retreat state: age the shared cooldown, keep facing the target, spin the
 * body, and count down to the next state (x5).
 *
 * First, unconditionally, `state[5] = (owner delta at *self+0x2c) * 30 / 3`. Note the base is
 * *self (self[0], the OWNER), NOT state (self[1]) -- the two are different objects and the ROM
 * loads *self here (`ldr r1,[r5]`) where the rest of the function uses state (`ldr r4,[r5,#4]`).
 * Then re-acquire the target; if present, store its heading (atan2 of the flattened aim) in
 * state[4]. Fetch a per-frame spin factor (020c9f48), transform a scratch vector by the owner's
 * matrix (*state+0xa0) into state+0x18, and scale it by that factor. Finally, unless the sub-node
 * at state[1]+0xad is busy, decrement the counter at state[0x12]: still positive -> stay in state
 * 0xb, expired -> drop to state 2.
 *
 * MATCHED off the SDK-vein template, and it is a clean win for the triage rule: it has real
 * control flow (a conditional aim, a two-way counter branch) and its scratch vectors are STACK
 * locals, so the scheduler had room and it matched at exact size on the first compile. Three
 * catalogued adjustments only:
 *  - the division is `* 0x1e / 3` (magic 0x55555556, no post-shift = divide by 3); NOT the /5 of
 *    ov142, and NOT the algebraic *10 (which would collapse to one mul).
 *  - `tmp` before `aim` in declaration order so the frame is aim=sp+0, tmp=sp+0xc (last-declared
 *    vector gets the lowest slot).
 *  - the counter's `<= 0` (state 2) arm is written FIRST -- the ROM's `bgt` sends the still-
 *    running case out of line.
 * The `*self` vs `state` base for the division was the one real trap: Ghidra prints `*param_1`
 * and it is easy to read as the state pointer, but it is the owner.
