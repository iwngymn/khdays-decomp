/*
 * Airborne step: drift the actor along its heading, and on landing hand off or bail out.
 *
 * The heading in state[0x11] is turned into a table index the usual way (the 0x28be60db9391
 * fixed-point scale, the same constant the sibling steer routine uses), then the sin/cos pair at
 * data_0203d210[idx*2] and [idx*2+1] becomes a flat direction. That direction is scaled by
 * state[0x12] / 40 into the step at state+0x20 and added to the owner's drift at owner+0x424.
 *
 * The node kind is read UP FRONT, before both vector calls, because the ROM keeps it live in a
 * callee-saved register across them; anything other than kind 3 returns here. For kind 3 the
 * owner's +0x60 high byte loses bit 0x40 and the landing flag decides the outcome: with a landing
 * point published, copy it to state+0x38, lift it by the owner's ground offset at +0x80, run the
 * three landing calls and arm the follow-up; without one, 020cce44 takes over.
 *
 * Two shapes had to be written exactly:
 *  - the +0x60 update is the BITFIELD form, not the extract/reassemble one: the ROM has the
 *    lsl #0x10 / lsr #0x10 truncation pair, which is the catalogued discriminator.
 *  - the landing flag is a ONE-BIT field, not a masked byte. The ROM reads it with
 *    ldrb + lsl #0x1f + lsrs #0x1f; a plain `& 1` test compiles to tst #1 and loses 4 bytes,
 *    because the short arm then falls inline instead of being placed out of line.
 *  - 020c0b90 takes the landing point BY VALUE: three words in r2, r3 and [sp], with the trailing
 *    zero as a separate fourth argument at [sp+4].
