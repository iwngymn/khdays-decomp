/*
 * func_ov210_020d1f14 -- pick the reaction: charge if the target is far enough, otherwise idle.
 * Does nothing while the byte at *state[3] is set. func_ov107_020cab14 hands back the target and
 * the SQUARED separation, so the gap is its square root less the target's radius (+0x80) and the
 * owner's (+0x80). A gap of 0xa000 or more parks the owner in state 5 and dispatches; anything
 * closer rolls a fresh delay into state[0x1b] from the owner's [+0x224, +0x228] range and parks
 * it in state 2.
 *
 * Parked at a symmetric r6/r7 swap between `target` and `owner`, with the note recording (rightly)
 * that caching `*state` in an `owner` local is load-bearing -- it keeps both values in callee-saved
 * registers across FX_Sqrt and is what fixed an earlier 16-byte gap. Two more steps close it:
 *  - the ROM stores the acquire result straight out of r0 and keeps the flag-setting copy in r7,
 *    so the STORE must come first and the local be bound from the slot
 *    (`state[4] = acquire(...); target = state[4];`), not the other way round;
 *  - `owner` must then be a FUNCTION-SCOPE declaration, because the swap is decided by declaration
 *    order and a block-scoped local is not in that ordering at all. tools/declperm.py picks the
 *    order out; every matching one has `target` last.
