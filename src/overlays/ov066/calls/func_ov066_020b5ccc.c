/* State-change request for the ov066 panel. Three states are handled specially: 0x2e
 * and 0x31 only tear down when the state actually changes, and 0/1/4 resolve a
 * transition argument -- but only if the object is currently displayable. When it is
 * not, that same case falls through into a validation step which demotes the panel to
 * state 0x2f if the requested state is not the one its table says it should be in.
 * Any other state is simply not handled here and drops straight to the tail, where the
 * panel either commits the resolved transition or takes the plain path.
 *
 * Two shapes here are load-bearing and neither is obvious.
 *
 * `case 0x30:` is empty and does nothing at runtime, but it is a real value in the
 * decision tree mwcc builds: with it, the upper arm is bounded from below
 * (cmp #0x30 / ble) before 0x31 is tested; without it, 0x31 is compared directly and
 * the function is eight bytes short. There must be no `default:` either -- giving the
 * unmatched states a block of their own moves the same comparison.
 *
 * nExpected is declared at function scope and assigned INSIDE the comparison. That is
 * what puts the model pointer in r2 and leaves r1 and r0 free for the table and the
 * expected value; declared inside the block, or assigned before the comparison, the
 * model lands in r1, the table is pushed to r0 and the expected value has to reuse the
 * dying model register. Assigning it above the whole condition also reaches r2 but
 * then the load cannot sink past the short-circuit and is emitted too early. */
