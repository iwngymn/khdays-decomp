/* Release the attachments the actor's current state no longer needs, then push its
 * transform down the node chain.  One of the x10 shared bodies across the enemy
 * overlays (ov166-ov177).
 *
 *  - if the actor is flagged (0x1c4 & 0xa) and has no pending state, and the current
 *    state is outside the whitelist {0, 1, 3, 0xc}, request state 0xc;
 *  - unless the state is 8, release the handle held in the control block at +0x39c
 *    and clear it;
 *  - unless the state is 9, destroy and null the two attachments at +0x3a0;
 *  - unless the state is 8, destroy and null the attachment at +0x3a8;
 *  - copy the 44-byte SRT transform from +0x394's node into +0x398's, and from there
 *    into the node behind +0x388, then run the shared ov107 update.
 *
 * PARKED as "register-naming ties only", with both residues correctly identified and
 * both wrongly attributed.  What actually differed:
 *  - the park's loop stored the null OUTSIDE the emptiness test.  The ROM's `beq`
 *    skips the call AND the store, so the store belongs inside.  Writing it outside is
 *    a different function, and it is what moved the scratch registers the note blamed.
 *  - the park indexed the attachment pair as `((int *)this)[0xe8 + i]`, folding the
 *    base into the index.  `((void **)(actor + 0x3a0))[i]` keeps the ROM's shape.
 *  - the 44-byte copies need no trick at all: a plain struct assignment through two
 *    casts gives the ROM's ldm/stm register roles.  The park's intermediate `pd`
 *    pointers are what inverted them.
 *
 * The note said "no C reordering flips mwcc's inline-block-move register roles", which
 * was true of the forms it tried and false of the function.
