 * each of the three part objects listed at +0x38c.
 *
 * The part is read as `((int *)obj)[i + 0xe3]`, with the 0x38c byte offset FOLDED INTO
 * THE INDEX. Written as `*(int *)(obj + i * 4 + 0x38c)` mwcc strength-reduces the loop
 * to a running byte offset and grows the frame by 8 bytes; with the constant inside the
 * subscript it recomputes `obj + i*4` every iteration, as the ROM does. */
