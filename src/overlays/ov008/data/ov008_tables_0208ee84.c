/* ov008 .rodata mission-progress tier table, 0x0208ee84-0x0208f044.
 *
 * 56 rows of 8 bytes, split at the original symbol boundaries.  The table
 * maps day/progress thresholds to the three mission-summary tier values.
 *
 * Why the u8 pieces are wrapped in single-field structs:
 * mwccarm gives every char array its own .rodata section, and the linker
 * command file's ALIGNALL(2) starts every section on an even address.  Two of
 * the symbol boundaries here are odd (0x0208ee89 and 0x0208f021), so as plain
 * u8 arrays the pieces after them were placed 1-3 bytes late and pushed the
 * rest of the overlay's .rodata 4 bytes down.  Everything that is not a char
 * array is pooled into one .rodata section with no padding between 1-byte
 * aligned items, so the u8 pieces are structs.  Symbol names, sizes, addresses
 * and bytes are unchanged; the code that reads them keeps declaring them as
 * `extern u8 name[]`.  A PC port does not need the wrappers.
