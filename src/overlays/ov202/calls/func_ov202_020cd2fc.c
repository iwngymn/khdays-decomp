/*
 * Close on the target, steering the step by how well it is already aimed (x2: ov202/ov203).
 *
 * The ov188 shape with one idea added. Re-acquire the target (020cab14); none -> state 2 and
 * advance. Take the owner->target vector (target+0x190 minus owner+0xb0), FLATTEN it (y = 0),
 * normalise for the distance, and store the heading (atan2) in state[3]. The gap is that distance
 * minus BOTH radii together -- `len - (target[0x80] + owner[0x80])`, parenthesised, which is what
 * the ROM's `add r2,r3,r2 ; sub r5,r0,r2` says and not the `(len - a) - b` of its ov188 sibling.
 *
 * The step is where it differs: the node's own heading becomes a sin/cos direction, and that
 * direction is DOTTED with the (normalised) aim vector. The absolute value of that dot -- 0x1000
 * when already facing the target, 0 when perpendicular -- scales the step via FX_Mul(dot, 0x300).
 * So it accelerates as it lines up. Then: gap at or past the owner's reach (owner+0x2d8) -> give
 * up (state 2); inside 0x1000 -> fire attack 9 (020c9264) and advance WITH a callback
 * (020cd4a0); otherwise keep closing.
 *
 * MATCHED ON THE FIRST COMPILE, and that is the point worth recording: nothing here was
 * discovered. The VEC_Set fingerprint sweep found it, and every piece was a lookup --
 *  - VEC_Set(&v, sin, 0, cos) for the direction (the fingerprint itself);
 *  - the Q12 radians->sin/cos conversion, catalogued, verbatim;
 *  - FX_Mul as the SDK inline: `((s64)v1 * v2 + 0x800) >> 12` is exactly the ROM's
 *    umull/mla/adds #0x800/lsr #12/orr chain;
 *  - `gap > 0x1000`, NOT Ghidra's `gap < 0x1001` -- 0x1001 is not an ARM immediate and would
 *    have come out of the pool (catalogued two commits ago, and it has now bitten in three
 *    consecutive functions);
 *  - `d` declared before `v` so the frame lays out sp+0xc / sp+0 as the ROM has it.
 * The relocs even carry VEC_Subtract and VEC_DotProduct by name -- the index knew what these
 * were all along.
