/*
 * Orbit the target, re-rolling the dwell timer and the next attack when it expires
 * (x2: ov202/ov203).
 *
 * Sibling of func_ov202_020cd2fc, and the difference is the whole behaviour. That one DOTS the
 * facing direction with the aim vector to accelerate as it lines up. This one takes the CROSS
 * PRODUCT of the facing direction with a vertical vector (0, height << 12, 0) -- giving a
 * direction PERPENDICULAR to where it is looking. It strafes around the target rather than
 * closing on it.
 *
 * Per tick: re-acquire (020cab14); none -> state 2 and advance. Aim vector owner->target,
 * flattened, normalised for the distance; heading (atan2) into state[3]; gap = distance minus both
 * radii together. The facing sin/cos crossed with the vertical gives the strafe direction, scaled
 * by state[0xe] into the step at state+0x14. While the dwell timer at state[0xc] is still running,
 * only bail if the gap has opened past 0x5000. When it expires: re-roll the timer from the owner's
 * [0x224, 0x228] range, then roll a d100 -- over 0x50 -> attack 7, otherwise attack 6.
 *
 * MATCHED. Everything was a lookup; the two worth their lines:
 *  - ★ THE RELOC NAME WAS THE FINDING. This compiled byte-identical while verify_idx still said
 *    DIFIERE -- reloc NAMES differed: what I had called `func_01ff8c34` is **VEC_CrossProduct**,
 *    and the index knew that all along. The skill says to read `orig = {...}` rather than invent
 *    names; here it also handed over the semantics for free. A "vector library call" became "it
 *    orbits", and the function got its name from it.
 *  - The RNG `add r0,r0,#0` copy is the catalogued crack, NOT a tie: `f(0x65) + (delta - delta)`.
 *    `+ 0` folds away; the subtraction of a live local does not. Without it this is 484 -- exactly
 *    one instruction short. (It reads like a typo. It is load-bearing; do not "clean it up".)
 *  - `gap < 0x5000` not Ghidra's `0x4fff <` (non-encodable, would hit the pool), and both branch
 *    pairs written with the arm the obvious reading puts second first.
 *  - Three stack vectors: declaration order `d, v, up` puts up at sp+0, v at sp+0xc, d at sp+0x18
 *    -- the LAST declared gets the lowest slot.
