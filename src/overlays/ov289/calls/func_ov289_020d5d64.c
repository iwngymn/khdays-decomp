/*
 * func_ov289_020d5d64 -- Ov287_Actor_ResolveHit.
 *
 * Hit resolution handler installed in the +0x1d0 slot by func_ov289_020d5664, shared with
 * ov288 and ov289. While the owner is in state 2 it either latches the other object and moves
 * the owner to state 4, when the event source's high halfword is 0x6b, or cancels through
 * ov107::020c9264. If the request asks for a latch and nothing is latched yet it stores the
 * other object, copies the contact point into the state block, answers 6 and turns that point
 * into a direction from the owner with the vertical component cleared; otherwise it answers 4.
 * It then runs the damage call and, unless the request is the guard-break shape, starts impact
 * event 0x15b with one of two sub-ids chosen by a toggle it flips afterwards. Always returns 1.
 *
 * Ghidra: Ov287_Actor_ResolveHit(Ov287Actor *pActor, void *pOther, ActorHitEvent *pEvent),
 * types /khdays/ActorHitState, /khdays/ActorHitEvent and /khdays/ImpactIdPairs, with
 * pHitState214 carved out of /khdays/Actor's former padding.
 *
 * Byte-exact codegen notes (mwccarm 3.0/139):
 *  - The request word is a pair of 16-bit BITFIELDS, not a u32 read through casts. Both
 *    spellings emit the same ldr plus lsl/lsr, but the cast form allocates three registers
 *    where the original uses two: it keeps the raw word in one register, narrows through a
 *    second and lands the halfword in a third. The bitfield pair narrows in place and matches.
 *    That single change was worth seven instructions here and no other spelling reached it --
 *    locals, masks, condition shape, declaration order and callee return types were all
 *    measured neutral.
 *  - The id table is copied as two two-byte members, the second one first, which is the order
 *    the original loads and stores them in. A single four-byte copy comes out ascending.
 *  - The two indexed reads use separate members so the base address is formed with
 *    `add r0, sp, #0` and `add r0, sp, #2`; indexing one array with `i` and `i + 2` makes mwcc
 *    add to the index instead.
