"""Find byte-exact C functions that are still called FUN_* in Ghidra.

The project's hard rule is that a match with no semantic layer is "half done" and does not count.
That rule relied on discipline and duly failed: on 2026-07-17 six rescued functions were committed
unnamed simply because rescuing does not feel like new decomp work. This makes the debt countable
instead of remembered.

Ghidra must be open with days.nds and the GhidraMCP plugin serving (TCP 127.0.0.1:8089 -- NOT 8080).
This is a read-only audit; it never mutates the program.

Usage:  python tools/audit_unnamed.py           # summary + per-overlay counts
        python tools/audit_unnamed.py --list    # every unnamed function

# `FUN_` is not the only way to have no name. `ov000_helper_4d354` passes a startswith('FUN_')
# test and means exactly as much -- 210 of them were hiding from this audit until 2026-07-17,
# which is the same "invisible until counted" failure the audit was written to fix.
#
# THIS IS THE ONE DEFINITION -- `namefam_propagate.py` imports it. It used to carry its own,
# slightly wider, copy; the two disagreed by 17 functions and the gap only showed up because a
# rename batch of 78 moved the audit by 61. Same lesson as the ARM/THUMB verify split: when two
# tools own one predicate, the bug lives in the difference.
#
# NOT placeholders: `WaitDivResult64_8ab0` and ~1035 like it. A semantic root with an address
# suffix is a disambiguated real name; only a placeholder *root* counts as debt.
#
# The separator is MANDATORY and the suffix must contain a digit, both to stop the regex eating
# real names: `SetFade` and `GetFace` are spelled entirely out of a-f, so `Set_?[0-9a-f]{4,8}$`
# matches them and this tool would have reported -- and namefam_propagate would have OVERWRITTEN
# -- two perfectly good names. An address suffix always carries a digit and always has the `_`.
