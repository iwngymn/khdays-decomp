"""Check that every parked file still COMPILES.

A file in nonmatching/ is not built by the ROM, so nothing notices when it stops
compiling -- and the whole reason to park a function with a write-up is that a later
session can re-test it.  One that will not compile is a dead end wearing the costume of
a lead: the next person runs verify_idx, gets a compiler error instead of a diff, and
has to reconstruct the source before they can even start.

func_ov181_020cd1e0.c sat broken in the tree for a day.  Its note listed the type
combinations it had tried, written as pointer types separated by slashes, and one of
those sequences accidentally spelled a comment terminator -- so the block comment closed
early and the typedef below it was parsed as code.  Nothing flagged it because parked
files are outside the build.
