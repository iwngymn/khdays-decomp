"""Find nonmatching/ files whose extern declares an arity the matched tree NEVER uses.

A dropped trailing argument does NOT change the function's size -- it just moves a constant into
the wrong register, so the diff reads as an unbreakable allocator permutation. Three parked
functions were rescued this way on 2026-07-17 (ov115_020ce20c, ov256_020cd8f0, ov212_020ce0d4),
one of which had a ten-variant write-up confidently blaming register allocation.

Usage:  python tools/audit_arity.py            # strict: my arity appears NOWHERE in the tree
        python tools/audit_arity.py --loose    # also show where the tree uses OTHER arities too

Strict hits are strong candidates. Loose hits are mostly noise: the tree legitimately calls many
of these through K&R decls with varying counts.

Then, for each hit: disassemble the call site and look at what the ROM sets in r0-r3 (and [sp]).
The giveaway is a `mov rN, #0` hoisted ABOVE a branch -- that means the same 0 feeds a field store
AND a call's trailing argument.
